# GC-Fish-nonlinear
Fisher matrix codes for nonlinear galaxy clustering

This repo contains Fisher matrix codes (Galaxy Clustering - GC) using the TNS and EFTofLSS models. 
The codes are written in Python and use the Jupyter Notebook application.
The codes have been developed by Dida Markovic and Alkistis Pourtsidou, and use input power spectra provided by Ben Bose.

Feel free to use and modify these codes for your own forecasts.
